    //
    // The upper bound is therefore set against the child's sleep, not against a
    // teardown budget. It has been wrong twice, in the same way both times:
    //
    //   - 14s left only 4s for everything outside the deadline — `tokscale`'s own
    //     process startup, `child.kill()`, `child.wait()` and joining the stdout
    //     pump — and on a Windows runner startup alone can consume most of that.
    //     It failed at 14.83s in CI (job 92167428621) while still killing the
    //     child correctly, so the bound was measuring runner speed rather than
    //     the behaviour this test is named for.
    //   - 18s, its replacement, kept a 2s margin below the child's then-20s sleep
    //     and failed at 21.17s in CI (run 31196968982, job 93170461116) — past the
    //     child's sleep entirely. At that point the bound could no longer separate
    //     "the parent killed the child at its deadline" from "the parent outlived
    //     the child", which is the one thing it exists to do, so raising it to 22s
    //     would have kept the test green while making it vacuous.
    //
    // Both failures came from squeezing the bound into a narrow gap between the
    // deadline and the child's sleep. The fix is to widen that gap instead: the
    // child now sleeps `FAKE_CODEX_SLOW_SLEEP_SECS` (120s) against the parent's
    // 10s deadline, so the two outcomes are 110s apart and the 60s bound has 50s
    // of headroom above the deadline and 60s below the child's sleep. A parent
    // that outlived the child cannot finish before 120s, and the ~11s of runner
    // startup that broke the 18s bound is a fifth of the headroom here.
    //
    // The lower bound stays at the parent's own deadline. It is exact by
    // construction: the child cannot exit on its own before then, so anything
    // faster means the parent gave up early.
    //
    // Note this test cannot catch #1049: the stand-in spawns nothing, so its pipe
    // closes the moment it is killed, and the drain after the kill returns at
    // once instead of waiting out `STDOUT_DRAIN_GRACE`. Widening the gap does not

    // that stretched the effective deadline to 50s would still kill the 120s
    // child, still report 124, and still land inside that window. This test pins
    // the deadline itself.
    //
    // It does so by subtracting two runs instead of bounding one. Everything a
    // run pays outside the deadline — `tokscale`'s process spawn, dynamic
    // linking, argument parsing, settings load, spawning and reaping the
    // stand-in on PATH — is paid by a fast run and a timed-out run alike, so it
    // cancels. What is left is the wait on the deadline.
    //
    // The numbers from the CI failure that forced the previous bound open (run
    // 31196968982, job 93170461116) show how completely it cancels. Against a
    // configured 10s deadline:
    //
    //     fast_success 11.16815s    fast_fail 11.0576809s    slow 21.173129s
    //     slow - fast_success = 10.0050s
    //     slow - fast_fail    = 10.1154s
    //
    // Every absolute number there is ~11s of runner overhead away from anything
    // a fixed threshold could use — that overhead alone is longer than the
    // deadline being measured, which is why no absolute bound survived. The
    // differences recover the deadline to within 0.12s, on the very runner that
    // was too slow for a bound of any width. The ~11s of startup noise is not
    // something this assertion tolerates; it is something it subtracts away.
    let fake_bin = create_fake_codex_bin();

    // The overhead is only common-mode once it is in steady state, and the first
    // run of the test binary is not. Measured locally: the first `tokscale`
    // spawn in this test costs 3.5-6.1s (paging in a debug binary, linking,
    // first execution of the freshly copied stand-in), and every spawn after it
    // costs ~45ms. Subtracting a cold baseline from a warm timed-out run charges
    // that one-off to the deadline and understates it — an early draft of this
    // test failed exactly that way, reporting a 3.96s deadline for a 10s
    // configured one because its single baseline happened to cost 6.09s.
    //
    // So the baseline is the minimum of two samples rather than one sample. The
    // noise here is one-sided — nothing can make a run finish faster than the
    // work it has to do, only slower — so the smallest sample is the best
    // estimate of the floor, and one unlucky sample no longer moves it. The
    // symmetric risk, a one-off landing on the timed-out run instead, is what
    // the tolerance below is sized for.

    // worst of those, so this is not the next bound that gets widened.
    //
    // Meaningful: it still fails loudly for the case the coarse window misses.
    // An effective deadline of 50s lands 35s outside the band; so does 2x; so
    // does anything past 1.5x. Five seconds is the largest tolerance that keeps
    // "the deadline is half again as long as it was configured to be" a red
    // test. It catches the opposite regression too — a deadline collapsing
    // toward zero — which the `[10s, 60s)` lower bound only appears to catch
    // because startup pads the measurement past 10s on its own.
    //
    // Widening this is a change of meaning, not of margin: the check is worth

    // `HEADLESS_SLOW_TIMEOUT_MS`. Run adjacent in time to the baseline on the
    // same machine, so the overhead the subtraction removes is the overhead that
    // was actually paid.
    //
    // The one-sided-noise argument that makes the baseline a minimum of two
    // samples applies to this side too, and this is the side that drives the
    // upper bound: a scheduling hit worth more than the tolerance would report a
    // deadline longer than the one that actually fired. So this side is a
    // minimum of samples as well — it is just sampled lazily, because each
    // sample costs a full `HEADLESS_SLOW_TIMEOUT_MS` and the baseline's cost
    // ~45ms once warm. The second sample is taken only when the first disagrees
    // with the configured deadline, so the steady-state cost stays one wait.
    //
    // Sampling lazily cannot hide a regression. A second sample is taken only
    // when the test is already failing, and a minimum can only move the estimate
    // down, so the retry can rescue a spike that inflated the measurement and
    // nothing else: a deadline that really is 5x too long measures ~50s twice
    // and still fails.
    //
    // That the minimum only moves down is also why the resample is conditioned
    // on the upper bound alone. A measurement below `low` — a deadline that
    // fired early, or a baseline that padded the run — cannot be moved back up
    // into the band by a minimum, so resampling it would spend another full
    // `HEADLESS_SLOW_TIMEOUT_MS` to reach the failure it had already reached.
    // The too-short case fails on the first sample.
    //
    // `saturating_sub` rather than `-`: a baseline longer than the timed-out run
    // means the deadline was not waited on at all, which is a failure to report,
    // not a subtraction overflow to panic on.

///
/// `TZ` is the instrument these tests pose their question with, and it is a
/// POSIX instrument. `chrono::Local` honors it on Unix; on Windows `Local`
/// reads `GetTimeZoneInformation` — the machine's own zone, which no
/// environment variable overrides. A test whose premise is "run this from Los
/// Angeles, then from Seoul" therefore runs twice from the runner's own zone
/// on Windows and asserts against buckets the host never produced. Concretely:
/// this fixture's two messages sit at 2026-03-02T11:30Z and 2026-03-02T18:00Z,
/// so a UTC runner buckets both into `2026-03-02` while the expectation is
/// Seoul's `03-02`/`03-03` split.
///
/// That is a statement about the instrument, and only about the instrument. It
/// is *not* a claim that the product was fine on Windows. It was not:
/// `detect_local_iana_name` declining to pin while a foreign `TZ` was set was
/// a real bug — the device never pinned, on any run, for as long as the
/// variable stayed set, and so kept the rescan-splits-history behaviour that
/// pinning exists to remove. It is fixed in `bucket_tz::tz_env_zone`, which no
/// longer offers `TZ` as the pin candidate on the platform where
/// `chrono::Local` does not read it.
///
/// That fix does not hand these tests their instrument back. `TZ` still cannot
/// move the zone the child buckets in on Windows, so these tests still cannot
/// place the child anywhere, and they stay gated. What the fix restored is
/// covered directly by the unit test
/// `bucket_tz::tests::a_foreign_tz_does_not_make_a_windows_host_unpinnable`,
/// which asserts the pinning behaviour itself rather than through `TZ`.
///
/// Tests that pin a zone through settings.json rather than through `TZ` stay
/// on every platform: the pin outranks the host, which is the whole claim.
